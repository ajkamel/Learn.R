def m1_text
'Like the Major Scale, it\'s relative Minor Scale has a pattern on which it is constructed. Notice how the A Minor scale also uses no black keys. So the pattern to construct it is: (W,h,W,W,h,W,W). The black keys are called "sharp" keys and are on half step higher in pitch than the corresponding natural key of the same name.'

def m1_les_text
  'Play an E Minor scale starting on E2, using the correct pattern.'
